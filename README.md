It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.Firstly,we imported the dataset and carried out exploratory data analysis,in which we found that there are null values in director,cast,country columns.We treated null values. In exploratory data analysis,we found distribution of TV shows and movies,content added monthly,yearly,analyzed various graphs and derived conclusions from them.We then performed feature engineering,text cleaning,and removed punctuations.
We used 5 clustering algorithms namely

3.DBSCAN 

4.Dendrogram 

5.Agglomerative clustering
